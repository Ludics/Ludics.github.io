Mortality is higher in more northern ereas of England after accounting for smoking, social class, diet and other known rick factors.

The higher people's blood levels of vitamin D are, the less heart disease and cancer they have. But only vitamin D is not enough. High vitamin D levels are a maker for sunlight exposure.

Nitric oxide, NO, was helping cells survice.

Skin have really large stores of NO3, NO2 and nitrosothiols, not NO. Sunlight might active those stores and release them from the skin.

To separate our story from the vitamin D story, they used ultraviolet A in experiments, which doesn't make vitamin D.

They put patients with these subjects under the UV, and their NO levels do go up, and their blood pressure goes down.

In "The Decay of Lying," Oscar Wilde establishes the idea that all bad art comes from copying nature and being realistic; and all great art comes from lying and deceiving, and telling beautiful, untrue things.

Reverb is the persistence of the sound after the original sound has ended, like all the reflection from materials, the objects and walls around the sounds.

Silence, in fact, is not real silence in most cases.

Ambiances, sounds in the environment, have different tones in different places. Ambiances can also indicate emotions or events.
