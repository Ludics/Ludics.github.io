Reverb is the persistence of the sound after the original sound has ended, like all the reflection from materials, the objects and walls around the sounds.

Silence, in fact, is not real silence in most cases.

Ambiances, sounds in the environment, have different tones in different places. Ambiances can also indicate emotions or events.
