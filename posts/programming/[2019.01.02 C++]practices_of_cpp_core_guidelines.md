# Practices of C++ Core Guidelines

> [C++ Core Guidelines](http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines), a set of core guidelines for modern C++ (currently C++17) taking likely future enhancements and ISO Technical Specifications (TSs) into account. The aim is to help C++ programmers to write simpler, more efficient, more maintainable code.

Today I was confused by the following: Why does our SDK have to use a C-style interface? For this, I looked up the documentation for the SDK and found that one of the core reasons is the ABI issue with C++. [Application binary interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface) (ABI) with C++ has been around for a long time, and there are no signs of improvement in the near future. To figure out this problem, I continue to look for relevant information. And finally, I found a great study material, [C++ Core Guidelines](http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines).

It's a long guide, and I will read it carefully and practice it. The relevant code will store in [GitHub](https://github.com/FebruaryBreeze/cpp-core-guideline-practices).

### 1. ABI and PImpl

> An **application binary interface** (**ABI**) is an [interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computing)) between two binary program modules; often, one of these modules is a [library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)) or [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) facility, and the other is a program that is being run by a user.

>  ABIs cover details such as:
>
> 1. a processor instruction set
> 2. the sizes, layouts, and alignments of basic data tyeps
> 3. the [calling convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calling_convention)
> 4. how an application should make [system calls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call) to the operating system
> 5. the binary format of [object files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_file), program libraries and so on.
